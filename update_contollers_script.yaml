      UpdateLevitonControllers

      Toggles the state of the switches/lights controlled by
      the network of VRCZ4 controllers based on device events.

      Also updates controller LEDs to match the state of the
      switches/lights.

      Can be called in 3 ways:

      1. When a controller button is pressed.
         Expected parameters:
         - ctrl_device_id(string) - zwave device_id of the controller.
         - value(int) - 1-4 if "On" side of the corresponding
           button was pressed. 5-8 if "Off" side was pressed.

      2. When a switch/light is toggled (physically or in UI)
         Expected parameters:
         - switch_entity_id(string) - entity name of the toggled
           switch/light.

      3. When controller level button is pressed.
         Expected parameters:
         - ctrl_device_id(string) - zwave device_id of the controller.
         - direction(string) - "up" or "down"
         (this is equivalent to "On" operation on the last controller
          button, followed by +/-40 brightness adjustment)

      Setup:
      
      Define below 'dev_db' dictionary of lists to represent the
      mapping of the controller buttons to the corresponding
      switches/lights in your network.

      Element 0 in each list corresponds to the 1st button,
      element 1 to the 2nd and so on. Up to 4 elements per list.
      
      E.g.
      {
        'abc': ['switch.entity1', 'light.entity2'],
        'xyz': ['light.entity3', 'light.entity2', 'switch.entity4']
      }

      represents a network of 2 controllers with device ids 'abc' and 'xyz'.
      Controller 'abc' has buttons 1 and 2 assigned to entity1 and entity2.
      Controller 'xyz' has buttons 1, 2, 3 assigend to entity3, entity2
      and entity4 in that order.
